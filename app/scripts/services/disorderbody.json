	"CHARGE Syndrome": "'CHARGE Syndrome': 'CHARGE syndrome (formerly known as CHARGE association), is a syndrome caused by a genetic disorder. It was first described in 1979. In 1981, the term \"CHARGE\" came into use as an acronym for the set of unusual congenital features seen in a number of newborn children.[1] The letters stand for: coloboma of the eye, heart defects, atresia of the nasal choanae, retardation of growth and/or development, genital and/or urinary abnormalities, and ear abnormalities and deafness. These features are no longer used in making a diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome, but the name remains. CHARGE syndrome is the leading cause of congenital deafblindness'",
	"Cardiomyopathy": "Cardiomyopathy (literally \"heart muscle disease\") is the measurable deterioration for any reason of the ability of the myocardium (the heart muscle) to contract, usually leading to heart failure. Common symptoms include dyspnea (breathlessness) and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs). Those with cardiomyopathy are often at risk of dangerous forms of irregular heart rate and sudden cardiac death.[1] The most common form of cardiomyopathy is dilated cardiomyopathy.[2][3] Although the term \"cardiomyopathy\" could theoretically apply to almost any disease affecting the heart, it is usually reserved for \"severe myocardial disease leading to heart failure\".[4]",
	"Rare urogenital tumor": "This term does not characterize a disease but a group of diseases. To learn about the diseases included under this term, you can consult the classifications."
